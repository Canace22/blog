整理一些日常开发中用到的提示词，给出了翻译和例句用法，方便查阅

## 1. 创建与修改

| Original | Translation | Explanation | Example Sentence |

| Develop | 开发 | In programming, "develop" refers to creating or building software, scripts, or applications. It implies writing code to achieve a specific functionality. The term is broad and can apply to various languages or project types. | **develop** a Python script that generates random sentences for the language learning app. |
| Edit | 编辑 | "Edit" in coding means modifying existing code to improve clarity, fix bugs, or enhance functionality. It often involves renaming variables, restructuring logic, or updating outputs for better user experience. | **edit** the JavaScript function to use descriptive variable names instead of single letters. |
| Create | 创建 | "Create" refers to building something new, such as a file, program, or webpage, from scratch. It emphasizes starting with a blank slate to produce a functional output. | **create** a simple HTML form to collect user input and display it in reverse. |
| Design | 设计 | "Design" in programming can refer to planning the structure, logic, or visual layout of a program or interface. It involves both aesthetic and functional considerations to ensure usability. | **Design** a C# program that counts vowels in a sentence and explains why this is useful. |
| Rewrite | 重写 | "Rewrite" means reworking existing code to improve its quality, readability, or functionality without changing its core purpose. It often involves refining outputs or logic. | **Rewrite** the PHP script to display more polite and detailed error messages. |
| Construct | 构建 | "Construct" is similar to "create" but emphasizes the process of assembling or structuring components, often with a focus on logic or flow in programming. | **Construct** a Ruby program that sorts a list of words alphabetically with clear user instructions. |
| Enhance | 增强 | "Enhance" means adding new features or improving existing ones in a program to make it more functional or user-friendly. | **Enhance** the Python script to let users choose a quote category like motivation or humor. |
| Compose | 编写 | "Compose" is a synonym for creating or writing, often used for scripts or applications with a creative or structured output, like games or stories. | **Compose** a Python script for a word-matching game with synonyms. |
| Revise | 修改 | "Revise" is similar to "edit" but often implies a more thorough review and improvement of code or text for clarity or simplicity. | **Revise** the JavaScript function to simplify its complex greeting output. |
| Build | 构建 | "Build" is akin to "create" or "construct" but often emphasizes the process of assembling a complete, functional system or webpage. | **Build** an HTML page with CSS to display a proverb and its meaning. |
| Update | 更新 | "Update" involves modifying code to improve functionality, add context, or fix issues while keeping the core purpose intact. | **Update** the PHP script to include more detailed feedback messages. |
| Modify | 修改 | "Modify" is a general term for changing code or functionality, often to add features or adjust behavior. | **Modify** the Java program to allow users to add a new verb to the list. |
| Extract | 提取 | "Extract" in programming refers to isolating a piece of code (e.g., a function or component) to make it reusable or modular. | **Extract** this button into a separate React component for reusability. |
| Refactor | 重构 | "Refactor" means restructuring code to improve its readability, efficiency, or maintainability without changing its functionality. | **Refactor** the button code into a reusable component with cleaner logic. |
| Adapt | 适配 | “适配”在技术语境中常指软件、硬件或系统之间的兼容与调整，英文用 “adapt” 最简洁自然；若强调“相互匹配”，也可译为 “fit” 或 “match”. | This app needs to adapt to both iOS and Android platforms.<br>（这个应用需要适配 iOS 和 Android 两大平台。） |

## 2. 分析与解释

| Original | Translation | Explanation | Example Sentence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Explain | 解释 | "Explain" requires providing a clear, understandable description of how something works, often breaking down complex logic into simple terms. In coding, this is often done via comments or documentation. | **explain** how a Python function checks if a word is a palindrome? |
| Analyze | 分析 | "Analyze" involves examining code, queries, or data to understand their structure, purpose, or performance. It often precedes optimization or debugging. | **Analyze** the SQL query to explain how it retrieves idioms from the database. |
| Clarify | 阐述 | "Clarify" means explaining or simplifying code, logic, or output to make it easier to understand, often through comments or plain language. | **Clarify** how a Python program splits a sentence into words and counts them. |
| Describe | 描述 | "Describe" involves explaining the purpose or functionality of code or a query in clear terms, often for documentation or user guidance. | **Describe** the purpose of a SQL query that filters words by length. |
| Reference | 参考 | “参考”在中文中多用于文档、编程、学术或技术场景，表示可供查阅、借鉴的资料或信息。在英语中，最标准对应词为 “reference”，尤其在编程（如 API reference）、论文（如 references 部分）或系统提示（如 “for reference”）中直接使用。若强调“供参考”，可译为 “for your reference” 或 “as a reference”. | 请参考下面的文档完成配置。<br>→ Please complete the configuration with reference to the document below.<br>或者：仅供参考。<br>→ For your reference only. |

## 3. 管理与组织

| Original | Translation | Explanation | Example Sentence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Organize | 整理 | "Organize" involves structuring code, data, or documentation in a way that makes it easier to search, use, or maintain. | **Organize** the prompt words into a document that’s easy to search and use. |
| Strategy | 策略 | "Strategy" refers to a plan or method designed to achieve a particular goal. In programming, it often relates to design patterns, algorithms, or approaches to solving problems. | **Strategy** pattern is used to define a family of algorithms and make them interchangeable. |
| Requirement | 要求 | "Requirement" refers to something that is demanded or needed, often used in software development to describe functional or non-functional specifications. | The **requirement** is to create a user authentication system with secure password validation. |
| Permission | 权限 | “权限”在中文中常用于计算机、软件或系统管理场景，指用户或程序被允许执行某些操作的权利。在英语中，最常用的对应词是 “permission”，尤其在技术文档、权限管理（如 Linux 的 chmod、Windows 的 ACL）中直接使用此词。若在更广泛的语境（如行政或法律），也可译为 “authority” 或 “authorization”，但此处保留技术领域的标准译法。 | 这个用户没有读取文件的权限。<br>→ This user does not have permission to read the file. |
| Revert | 恢复 | "Revert" means undoing changes to restore a previous version of code or a system, often used in version control or debugging. | **Revert** the recent changes to the code to restore the original functionality. |
